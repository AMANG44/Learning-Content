# Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical technique to convert high dimensional data to low dimensional 
  data by selecting the most important features that capture maximum information about the dataset.

# The features are selected on the basis of variance that they cause in the output. 
  The feature that causes highest variance is the first principal component. 
  The feature that is responsible for second highest variance is considered the second principal component, and so on. 
  
# The Variance for Each Feature is as Follows.
   
   Feature        1         2           3         4         5           6         7           8          9         10
   Variance 0.23726612 0.17676103 0.15981101 0.09621538 0.09111189 0.08667718 0.07268585 0.04182227 0.01873639 0.01269897
# Here We can see that variance is continuously decreasing for each feature.
# Henc PCA1 = Feature1
   and PCA1 = Feature2
   
# These Matches with my intuition of best Features.
